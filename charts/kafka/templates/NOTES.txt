- You can connect to this kafka only within the cluster itself.
- the connection string is : 
```
**{{ (include "kafkaList" .)}}**
```
- example for producer python :

```
from confluent_kafka import Producer
import socket

conf = {'bootstrap.servers': "{{ (include "kafkaList" .) }}",
        'client.id': socket.gethostname()}

producer = Producer(conf)
```

*NOTES about deletion :*

- **You can safely delete this chart and recreate one later**
- Data volumes will not be deleted
- If you start a new {{ .Chart.Name }}, it will reuse those volumes silently.
- If you want to delete those volume definitily : `kubectl delete pvc {{ join " " $pvcList }}`
